Let's create a configmap that the new scheduler will employ using the concept of ConfigMap as a volume.
We have already given a configMap definition file called my-scheduler-configmap.yaml at /root/ 
path that will create a configmap with name my-scheduler-config using the content of file /root/my-scheduler-config.yaml.

apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler
leaderElection:
  leaderElect: false
  
  
===Deploy an additional scheduler to the cluster following the given specification.
Use the manifest file provided at /root/my-scheduler.yaml. Use the same image as used by the default kubernetes scheduler.
