#OS Upgrades Process in Kuberneties Cluster

Upgrade the controlplane components to exact version v1.29.0

Upgrade the kubeadm tool (if not already), then the controlplane components, 
and finally the kubelet. Practice referring to the Kubernetes documentation page.

Controlplane Node Upgraded to v1.29.0

Controlplane Kubelet Upgraded to v1.29.0
Make sure that the correct version of kubeadm is installed and then proceed to upgrade the controlplane node. 
Once this is done, upgrade the kubelet on the node.


To seamlessly transition from Kubernetes v1.28 to v1.29 and gain access to the packages specific to the desired Kubernetes minor version, follow these essential steps during the upgrade process. This ensures that your environment is appropriately configured and aligned with the features and improvements introduced in Kubernetes v1.29.

On the controlplane node:

Use any text editor you prefer to open the file that defines the Kubernetes apt repository.

vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
Update the version in the URL to the next available minor release, i.e v1.29.

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /
After making changes, save the file and exit from your text editor. Proceed with the next instruction.

root@controlplane:~# apt update
root@controlplane:~# apt-cache madison kubeadm
Based on the version information displayed by apt-cache madison, it indicates that for Kubernetes version 1.29.0, the available package version is 1.29.0-1.1. Therefore, to install kubeadm for Kubernetes v1.29.0, use the following command:

root@controlplane:~# apt-get install kubeadm=1.29.0-1.1
Run the following command to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster.

root@controlplane:~# kubeadm upgrade plan v1.29.0
root@controlplane:~# kubeadm upgrade apply v1.29.0
Note that the above steps can take a few minutes to complete.

Now, upgrade the version and restart Kubelet. Also, mark the node (in this case, the "controlplane" node) as schedulable.

root@controlplane:~# apt-get install kubelet=1.29.0-1.1
root@controlplane:~# systemctl daemon-reload
root@controlplane:~# systemctl restart kubelet
root@controlplane:~# kubectl uncordon controlplane

Upgrade the worker node to the exact version v1.29.0

Worker Node Upgraded to v1.29.0

Worker Node Ready

ake sure that the correct version of kubeadm is installed and then proceed to upgrade the node01 node. 
Once this is done, upgrade the kubelet on the node.

On the node01 node, run the following commands:

If you are on the controlplane node, run ssh node01 to log in to the node01.

Use any text editor you prefer to open the file that defines the Kubernetes apt repository.

vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
Update the version in the URL to the next available minor release, i.e v1.29.

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /
After making changes, save the file and exit from your text editor. Proceed with the next instruction.

root@node01:~# apt update
root@node01:~# apt-cache madison kubeadm
Based on the version information displayed by apt-cache madison, it indicates that for Kubernetes version 1.29.0, the available package version is 1.29.0-1.1. Therefore, to install kubeadm for Kubernetes v1.29.0, use the following command:

root@node01:~# apt-get install kubeadm=1.29.0-1.1
# Upgrade the node 
root@node01:~# kubeadm upgrade node
Now, upgrade the version and restart Kubelet.

root@node01:~# apt-get install kubelet=1.29.0-1.1
root@node01:~# systemctl daemon-reload
root@node01:~# systemctl restart kubelet
Type exit or logout or enter CTRL + d to go back to the controlplane node.
